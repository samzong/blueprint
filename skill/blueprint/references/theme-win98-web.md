# Theme: win98-web

Use a Windows 95/98 Classic-inspired browser document shell for `archive`, not an operating-system replica.

## Visual contract

- `#c0c0c0` canvas, `#e0e0e0` sidebar, white inset article
- native-looking `outset`, `inset`, and `ridge` borders
- `#000080` active item with white text; browser-blue links
- Times New Roman body, Arial/Helvetica navigation, Courier New code
- square corners; no gradients, modern shadows, glass, pills, or rounded cards

## Layout

- Desktop: sticky `280px` document rail and fluid article
- Below `820px`: rail above the article, capped at `45vh`
- Full-width left-aligned document buttons
- Horizontal overflow for tables and code

## Interaction

- Search filters titles and paths immediately.
- Hash routes preserve direct links and reloads.
- ZIP download preserves relative Markdown paths.
- Mermaid loads only when the active document contains a diagram.
